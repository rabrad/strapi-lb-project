## create a middleware to populate strapi query string

Using a long query string can be hard and to manage. so example of [interactive-query-builder](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest/interactive-query-builder). Creating a middleware will gave you a short query but will all designed data you need to query form stapi. in our case in this project: `http://localhost:1337/api/landing-pages`

to create a middleware, follow the run `yarn strapi console` and create a new middleware, name it and define it location.

1- add the query string that you need to be populated and call it in the ctx:

    "use strict";

    const populate = {
      metadata: {
        populate: {
          metaImage: {
            populate: true,
            fields: ["name", "alternativeText", "url"],
          },
        },
      },
      blocks: {
        populate: {
          link: {
            populate: true,
          },
          image: {
            fields: ["name", "alternativeText", "url"],
          },
          card: {
            populate: {
              image: {
                fields: ["name", "alternativeText", "url"],
              },
            },
          },
        },
        plan: {
          populate: ["services", "link"],
        },
        form: {
          populate: ["input", "button"],
        },
      },
    };

    module.exports = (config, { strapi }) => {
      // Add your own logic here.
      return async (ctx, next) => {
        strapi.log.info("In landing-page-populate middleware.");
        ctx.query = {
          populate,
          ...ctx.query,
        };

        await next();
      };
    };

2- Add the middleware to the `createCoreRouter` in `src/api/landing-page/routes`

    const { createCoreRouter } = require("@strapi/strapi").factories;

    module.exports = createCoreRouter("api::landing-page.landing-page", {
      config: {
        find: {
          middlewares: ["global::landing-page-populate"],
        },
        findOne: {
          middlewares: ["global::landing-page-populate"],
        },
      },
    });

3- run `yarn develop`
